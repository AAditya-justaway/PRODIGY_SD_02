🌟 Task Completion Update 🌟



I'm excited to share that I've completed my second task at Prodigy Infotech during my internship. I built a guessing game that challenges the user to guess a random number, providing feedback along the way.



Here's what I learned during this task:

- 🔢 Random Number Generation

- ✋ User Input Handling

- 🔄 Loops and Conditionals

- 🛠️ Debugging and Troubleshooting
